Prevent 1 account from being used simultaneously. Perfect for websites that sell subscriptions and want to prevent accounts from being shared.

== Description ==

This plugin allows 1 person to log into 1 WordPress account using 1 application/device at 1 time. If another person tried to log in from a different location, they will get an error message and be unable to access the account until the original user leaves. 

Works even if the original user doesn’t click “log out” before closing. The account will just time out, and then the user can log in in a different location.

1. Upload the ‘mp-restrict-logins’ folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
